"""Generate .github/labels.json from the authoritative prefix list in prLinter.yml.

Run from the repository root after adding a prefix to prLinter.yml:

    .github/generate-labels.py .github/workflows/prLinter.yml .github/labels.json

It fails rather than guessing when a prefix has no colour, so a new prefix cannot
silently become a default grey label the first time someone uses it in a PR title.
